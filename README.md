About
---
Targeting rooted servers, reads memory from `sshd` and `sudo` system calls that handle password based authentication. Doesn't write any memory to the traced processes. Spawns a new process for every `sshd` and `sudo` command that is run.

Listens for the `proc` event using netlink sockets to get candidate processes to trace. When it receives an `sshd` or `sudo` process `ptrace` is attached and traces `read` and `write` system calls, extracting strings related to password based authentication.

Don't really like the solution of backdooring openssh or installing a kernel module on target servers so I made this.

Build
---
```sh
make
./3snake -h
./3snake
```





Usage
---

Run in current terminal
`./3snake`

Daemonize and dump output to file
`./3snake -d -o "/tmp/output_file.txt"`

Configuration
---
Located in [config.h](https://github.com/blendin/3snake/blob/master/src/config.h)
- __ROOT_DIR__ - root directory when daemonized (relative file paths for -o option will end up here)
- __ENABLE_SSH__ - OpenSSH server password auth
- __ENABLE_SUDO__ - sudo password auth
- __ENABLE_SU__ (experimental) - su password auth
- __ENABLE_SSH_CLIENT__ (experimental) - ssh client password auth
- __ENABLE_PASSWD__ - `passwd` password changes

Limitations
---
Linux, ptrace enabled, /proc filesystem mounted
